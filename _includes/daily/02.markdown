__Warm-up activity.__ 


Once you complete the activity, download it in PDF format: 
`File -> Download As ... -> PDF Document (pdf)` 

The completed PDF file should be submitted to Gradescope for grading (only one person from your group needs to submit the activity; you will have a chance to enter the names of all group members once you upload the file). 

Here are quick steps for uploading to Gradescope:

* Go to [gradescope.com](http://gradescope.com) and log in with you NYU email address (the version that contains your NetID).
* On your Courses page, select the course for which youâ€™re submitting work.
* On your Courses page, you will see all of your current assignments. Click on the assignment you are turning in.
* Click Submit PDF > Click Select PDF > locate the correct file on your computer > Click Upload PDF
* Finally, add the group members to the submission: on the right hand side under the name of the person who submitted the assignment, you should see "Add Group Members" link. Use it to add up to 3 more student names to the submission. (If you skip this step the other group members won't get credit for their work.)
